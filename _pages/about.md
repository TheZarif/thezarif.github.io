I'm Zarif Masud, a PhD student in Computer Engineering at Toronto Metropolitan University, co-supervised by Dr. Ebrahim Bagheri and Dr. Ishtiaque Ahmed. My research interests sit at the intersection of responsible AI, social computing, and migration studies. Using techniques from natural language processing and information retrieval, I take a critical lens to observe how immigration is framed across various media and popular culture, and how data driven systems embed within them biased frames that end up marginalizing migrants.
